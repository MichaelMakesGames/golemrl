GolemRL is a roguelike in development. The player takes control of a partially formed golem banished to the depths of a cave by its creator. The golem is tasked with climbing through the cave and ascending the tower to confront its creator, the sorcerer.

The game is currently very early in development, and core mechanics are still being developed. Mechanics for combat, map generation, body part upgrades, spells, and stealth are in the game and working, but content is lacking.

DEPENDENCIES: This code requires libtcod 1.5.2 to run (and thus also SDL), and the NetworkX and PyYAML modules for Python.
