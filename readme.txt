GolemRL is a roguelike in development. The player takes control of a partially formed golem banished to the depths of a cave by its creator. The golem is tasked with climbing through the cave and ascending the tower to confront its creator, the sorcerer.

The game is currently very early in development, and features little more than the generation of a single cave system. Basic combat and monsters will soon be added, then progression, magic, body modification, full dungeon generation, etc. For more details on the plans for the game itself, consult the design doc (currently outdated).

DEPENDENCIES: This code requires libtcod 1.5.2 to run (and thus also SDL), and the networkx python module.
